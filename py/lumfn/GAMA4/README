This table contains the tiling catalog (TC) sources for the GAMA II
equatorial survey regions.

Dependencies: InputCatAv06, SpecCatv26 DMU, PhotoZv03. 

Changes from v44/v45: update of SpecCat from v26 to v27. This fixed
a bug where sometimes the best spectrum was not identified correctly. 
This results in 43 specid differences. 

Derived from InputCatAv06, selecting GAMA regions (5x12), applying
magnitude limits, star-galaxy separation, SB limits, and mask.
See <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.404...86B">Baldry et al. 2010</a> for details. 

For science catalogs: select SURVEY_CLASS >= 3 for union of GAMA II
Main Survey and GAMA I Main Survey. MS (used below) is this union.
Reliable redshifts can now be taken as (nQ >= 3) or (nQ2_flag >= 1). 
The number of MS targets with reliable redshifts is 188810 (98.85%).

GAMA II Main Survey = r < 19.8 based on DR7 mags; GAMA I Main Survey = 
r < 19.4 (G09,G15) or r < 19.8 (G12) or K_AB < 17.6 or z_{model} < 18.2
based on DR6 mags over area_flag=2. The latter were obtained by
matching to TilingCatv11 (or v16). The column TC_V11_ID gives the
CATAID in v11 which is identical to CATAID in this table except over a
small area in G09 - and is -1 if there is no match to a TC v11
object. Over an area in the southern part of G09, the imaging used is
different between InputCatAv05 (TC v11) and InputCatAv06 (this version
of TC). See also the table <a href="/db/schema/table.php?id=317">GamaIToGamaII</a> in this DMU.

Filler sample is H-ATLAS selections in all three regions, 19.8-19.85
in all and multi-wavelength SDSS selections in G12 as per that used in
TC v11.

The heliocentric redshifts are obtained by matching to <a href="/db/schema/table.php?id=416">SpecAllv26</a>. Matches
are by CATAID except for a few cases. There are 6 cases where an object is
matched within 1 arcsec to a spectrum that has been assigned to another
object. These are all vis_class=3 objects. Most of the redshifts are
obtained from GAMA-AAOmega autoz (Baldry et al. 2014) or SDSS DR10 (Bolton
et al. 2012). For cosmological distances, it is recommended to use z_cmb
or z_tonry from the <a href="/db/schema/dmu.php?name=LocalFlowCorrection">LocalFlowCorrection</a> DMU.

NUM_GAMA_SPEC is the number of GAMA-AAOmega spectra matched to the
target within 1 arcsec. This parameter NUM_GAMA_SPEC is used to assess
the progress of obtaining good redshifts, see PV below.

Expanded explanation of some columns below.

...............................................................................

NQ2_FLAG

This flag is for tests of NQ=2 redshifts against independent
measurements. First of all, the SpecAll table was trimmed to redshifts
with nQ=2, and redshifts with SPECID that matched to SPECID2 or
SPECID3 from AATSpecAutozComb were removed. The latter procedure is
because these spectra have already been used in combination for some
of the redshifts. z_photo measurements were taken from the PhotoZ DMU.

For this flag two tests were performed: (i) redshifts with PROB > 0.7
and |(z_photo - z_spec)/(1 + z_spec)| < 0.07 were given a value of
NQ2_FLAG = 1, and (ii) redshifts that agreed with an independent NQ=2
redshift were given a value NQ2_FLAG = NQ2_FLAG + 2. Thus, a value of
3 means both tests were satisfied.

It is left up to the users to decide whether NQ2_FLAG >= 1 redshifts
should be considered reliable.

...............................................................................

VEL_ERR

This gives the redshift uncertainty, assuming the correct redshift
peak has been assigned, in velocity units, i.e., c delta ln(1+z). For
GAMA-AAOmega and SDSS DR10, the estimate is individually calibrated
for each spectrum, for details, see Baldry et al. (2014) and Bolton et
al. (2012), respectively. The SDSS velocity errors have had 10 km/s
added in quadrature. For the other redshifts, a quantised estimate is
given depending on SURVEY_CODE and NQ values. For example, 2dFGRS/MGC
Q=4 redshifts have been assigned a VEL_ERR of 85 km/s, similar to the
Colless et al. (2001) estimate. Overall, VEL_ERR ranges from 10 km/s
to 160 km/s, which is a set upper limit; excluding assigned -99.9
values for no redshift measurement.

VIS_CLASS for visual classification

0   = not eyeballed
1   = yes a target
2   = not a target (no evidence of galaxy light)
3   = not a target (not the main part of a galaxy)
4   = compromised photometry (selection mag has serious error)
255 = not eyeballed but the following SDSS flags are *all* zero:
      EDGE, BLENDED, CHILD, MAYBE_CR, MAYBE_EGHOST

...............................................................................

SURVEY_CLASS (SC)

sc = 0:  not a target (except for checks on vis_class=3)
sc = 1:  filler targets - 19.8-19.85, multi-lambda (G12)
sc = 2:  H-ATLAS targets
sc >= 3: *** MS *** union of GAMA II main survey and GAMA I main survey
sc >= 4: r < 19.8, GAMA II main survey
sc >= 5: r < 19.8 and satisfies r-band star-galaxy separation
sc = 6:  r < 19.4 and satisfies r-band star-galaxy separation

See 'Input catalogue and star-galaxy separation' (IC) paper for
details on selection.

Further note: objects with target_flags=0 (also survey_class=0) have
2 <= vis_class <= 4 or they are excluded by Eq. 12 only of the IC
paper (Sec. 5.2). These remain in the tiling catalogue because they
are rejected by a more subjective criteria than the other selections.

...............................................................................

SURVEY_OLDCLASS (soc)

soc = 0:  not a target (except for checks on vis_class=3)
soc = 1:  filler targets - 19.8-19.85, multi-lambda (G12)
soc = 2:  H-ATLAS targets
soc >= 3: *** MS *** union of GAMA II main survey and GAMA I main survey
soc >= 4: GAMA I main survey
soc >= 5: GAMA I main survey r or z-selected
soc >= 6: GAMA I main survey r-selected only
soc = 7:  r < 19.0 and sg_sep > 0.25 (Year 1 high priority targets)
